# DeepRL
Highly modularized implementation of popular deep RL algorithms by PyTorch. My principal here is to reuse as much components as possible through different algorithms and switch easily between classical control tasks like CartPole and Atari games with raw pixel inputs.

Implemented algorithms:
* (Double/Dueling) Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
* Categorical DQN (C51, Distributional DQN with KL Distance)
* Quantile Regression DQN (Distributional DQN with Wasserstein Distance)
* Synchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
* Synchronous N-Step Q-Learning
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* (Continuous/Discrete) Synchronous Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Action Conditional Video Prediction

Asynchronous algorithms below are removed in current version but can be found in [v0.1](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL/releases/tag/v0.1).
* Async Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)
* Async One-Step Q-Learning
* Async One-Step Sarsa 
* Async N-Step Q-Learning
* Continuous A3C
* Distributed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (Distributed DDPG, aka D3PG)
* Parallelized Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O, similar to DPPO)

Support for PyTorch v0.3.x can be found in [v0.2](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL/releases/tag/v0.2). Note all the figures are generated via this version. After the upgrade to PyTorch v0.4.0, I have only tested the classical control tasks. 

# Curves
> Curves for CartPole are trivial so I didn't place it here, and there isn't any fixed random seed. The curves are generated in the same manner as OpenAI baselines (one run and smoothed by recent 100 episodes)

**Left**: One-step prediction **Right**: Ground truth

Prediction is sampled after 110K iterations, and I only implemented one-step training
